      <description>Woke up early today and did cardio. Almost puked but the cold shower afterwards hit different.&#xA;Also super locked in at work.&#xA;Had K-BBQ at home for dinner with pork belly and organ meats.&#xA;I asked Jherzey to help me skin the cat and it definitely scared her. I did more after she left but my right shoulder started hurting. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to take it easy on the shoulder exercises.</description>

      <description>Pretty productive day!&#xA;Found a beat for focusing at work so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit in silence anymore.&#xA;I also tried out some online shopping haul with Jherzey after work before eating momos.&#xA;Just now, I set up Anki with Cantonese flashcards. I picked one without Chinese characters so I actually have to associate sounds to meaning.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been consistently waking up at 7 which means that I can finally get to sleep early (which is why I&amp;rsquo;m actually able to write before midnight now).</description>

      <description>Went straight to University after meeting my friend David to tour the Gen Z gang around the campus.&#xA;It was pretty nice to go back to the places I used to study in pre-pandemic and tell them about it.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s the exact spot where I studied for my first Math midterm. My heart was beating fast the whole time. Not sure if it was from nerves or from coffee&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;We used to do labs here until 8 pm&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Peeled a bunch of garlic cloves today.&#xA;Also went skating for a bit with Jherzey. Her skates were too small for her so we didn&amp;rsquo;t stay too long.&#xA;Also planned how much I would need to save up this year. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna be tough considering I still have one more major trip.</description>

      <description>Slept pretty much until the afternoon and then worked on CitySync stuff.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s already Sunday so I basically skipped 2 days of journalling. I definitely need to streamline this process. I could try using Obsidian for easier journalling and then automate the publishing process.</description>

      <description>Hung out with the Gen Z gang today (actually millennials).&#xA;Walked around downtown at -20Â°C which was fun.&#xA;Went hotpot and Hanjan which basically broke resolutions 1 &amp;amp; 3 but it&amp;rsquo;s all good.</description>

      <description>I got my passport today so I am now legally allowed to leave the country ðŸ˜Œ&#xA;I think I should start scheduling my off-work hours because I&amp;rsquo;m bad at time management and get distracted easily. It&amp;rsquo;s already past midnight that I&amp;rsquo;m writing on the journal.&#xA;EDIT:&#xA;I forgot to add why I wanted to do this in the first place. I found an old notebook of mine from 5+ years ago that had this entry:</description>
