            Being a Tagalog speaker and a language learner, I&rsquo;ve always been interested in etymology of Tagalog words. The obvious influences are Spanish and English, but there&rsquo;s also a lot from Hokkien and Malay.
Today I&rsquo;m going to list out some words that I find interesting:
Linggo (Sunday; week) - All the days in Tagalog are directly borrowed from Spanish one to one, except for Sunday (domingo). Apparently it could be from Malay minggu which came from Portuguese domingo.

            I actually got up at 6 and felt a lot more motivated today. The fact that I was probably around only 70% productivity the day before meant that I had to go ham today. I finally got around starting my daily/weekly planner (and actually following it).
Also the fact that I also got approved for my PH vacation gave me a lot more motivation.
Walked to Jherzey&rsquo;s place while it was raining and super slippery outside.

            This was the day that I got up at 6 but stayed in bed until 9 ðŸ˜­ so much for waking up early.
I ate a small clove of garlic in the morning and it was pretty spicy. Tried eating a bigger one and it gave me a crazy heartburn.
Had a CitySync discussion with Michael before he leaves for Vietnam.
I also tried out Reaper but didn&rsquo;t get too far.

            Woke up early today and did cardio. Almost puked but the cold shower afterwards hit different.
Also super locked in at work.
Had K-BBQ at home for dinner with pork belly and organ meats.
I asked Jherzey to help me skin the cat and it definitely scared her. I did more after she left but my right shoulder started hurting. I&rsquo;m gonna have to take it easy on the shoulder exercises.

            Pretty productive day!
Found a beat for focusing at work so I don&rsquo;t have to sit in silence anymore.
I also tried out some online shopping haul with Jherzey after work before eating momos.
Just now, I set up Anki with Cantonese flashcards. I picked one without Chinese characters so I actually have to associate sounds to meaning.
I&rsquo;ve also been consistently waking up at 7 which means that I can finally get to sleep early (which is why I&rsquo;m actually able to write before midnight now).

            Finally found some appropriate background music for when I&rsquo;m working.
My peers used to always ask me what I listen to while working on my computer, and they&rsquo;re always shocked to find out that I work in silence. I used to unironically listen to lofi hip hop mix ðŸ“š beats to relax/study to but I get too sleepy. When I listen to music I actually like listening to, I get too distracted.

            Went straight to University after meeting my friend David to tour the Gen Z gang around the campus.
It was pretty nice to go back to the places I used to study in pre-pandemic and tell them about it.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the exact spot where I studied for my first Math midterm. My heart was beating fast the whole time. Not sure if it was from nerves or from coffee&rdquo;

            Peeled a bunch of garlic cloves today.
Also went skating for a bit with Jherzey. Her skates were too small for her so we didn&rsquo;t stay too long.
Also planned how much I would need to save up this year. It&rsquo;s gonna be tough considering I still have one more major trip.

            Slept pretty much until the afternoon and then worked on CitySync stuff.
It&rsquo;s already Sunday so I basically skipped 2 days of journalling. I definitely need to streamline this process. I could try using Obsidian for easier journalling and then automate the publishing process.

            Hung out with the Gen Z gang today (actually millennials).
Walked around downtown at -20Â°C which was fun.
Went hotpot and Hanjan which basically broke resolutions 1 &amp; 3 but it&rsquo;s all good.

I think I should start scheduling my off-work hours because I&rsquo;m bad at time management and get distracted easily. It&rsquo;s already past midnight that I&rsquo;m writing on the journal.

I forgot to add why I wanted to do this in the first place. I found an old notebook of mine from 5+ years ago that had this entry:

            Fall 2023 was my first semester coming back after being out of school for 16 months (I tried taking CHINA 101 in Fall 2022 but dropped it after a week).
Because of that, I have forgotten how to study. Both midterms and finals went pretty horribly. It&rsquo;s not even that I don&rsquo;t care about grades anymore, and I definitely could have done better if I just did the practice exams thoughtfully.

            A couple of months ago, I help a friend set up a website for a business. Today, I had another talk with a friend about building a portfolio website and he asked me for a few resources. I couldn&rsquo;t find a comprehensive one that outlines all the required steps so I&rsquo;ll try my best.
What is a static website? From ChatGPT:
Basically:
Static - no server-side logic, cheaper Dynamic - with server-side logic, more expensive What makes a (static) website Setting up a static website is basically free these days, maybe a few dollars a year if you want a custom domain.

            I deleted all 4 of my NPM packages today. It has been over a year since I&rsquo;ve last updated them, and I didn&rsquo;t want to add any more clutter to the system.
I&rsquo;ve always thought that having published open source code meant something, but then I realized that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s not useful.
Learning how to package libraries and applications was a good experience, though, and I would probably publish stuff IF/WHEN I have actually solved a need.

            I feel like the hardest part of writing this game would be the enemy logic. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m putting it off for as long as possible! Today I implemented map generation, randomly placing boxes sufficiently far enough from players.
I also added controls for other players, which reminded me of my local multiplayer experience with Boxhead. I miss having multiple people on play a single keyboard. These days it would be awkward to play that way.

            Feeling good today. I got to fix the collision bug that was happening yesterday. It actually had to do with the collision lifecycle, so to make the player detectable, I decoupled the check from the lifecycle of the bomb. Because of this, I could revert the player&rsquo;s bomb timer to normal. Moving away from a project and letting your brain sit on a problem for a while really does wonders.

            MAJOR BUG ALERT!!
Apparently my collision logic for the bombs weren&rsquo;t going to hold up. Every time a bomb explodes, there is a small time window where you can place a bomb and the bomb would not recognize the player, making it a &ldquo;not new&rdquo; bomb. Because of that, the player gets pushed off right away and could end up in the weirdest of places.
After hours of debugging I couldn&rsquo;t really solve it because of how the collision library orders the entity updates.

            <p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been heavily configuring my text editor, Neovim, which means that I&rsquo;ve been writing a lot of Lua. I do
find it enjoyable, even without having any tooling initially, so I wanted to give game development and
<a href="https://love2d.org">Love2D</a> a try. I just finished
<a href="https://www.sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents">Sheepolution&rsquo;s How to LÃ–VE</a> book on Love2D, and felt prepared to make
my first game from scratch. As per Jherzey&rsquo;s request, I&rsquo;m creating a Bomberman clone.</p>

            <p>Today I learned what my actual height was (at least at the time of writing). For a few years now I&rsquo;ve always kind of
just stuck with 170 cm because that&rsquo;s what was in my driver&rsquo;s license when I got it 5 years ago (I really need to pass
the road test this year). I&rsquo;m not even sure if that was right at the time.</p>
