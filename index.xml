      <description>Woke up early today and did cardio. Almost puked but the cold shower afterwards hit different.&#xA;Also super locked in at work.&#xA;Had K-BBQ at home for dinner with pork belly and organ meats.&#xA;I asked Jherzey to help me skin the cat and it definitely scared her. I did more after she left but my right shoulder started hurting. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to take it easy on the shoulder exercises.</description>

      <description>Pretty productive day!&#xA;Found a beat for focusing at work so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit in silence anymore.&#xA;I also tried out some online shopping haul with Jherzey after work before eating momos.&#xA;Just now, I set up Anki with Cantonese flashcards. I picked one without Chinese characters so I actually have to associate sounds to meaning.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been consistently waking up at 7 which means that I can finally get to sleep early (which is why I&amp;rsquo;m actually able to write before midnight now).</description>

      <title>Background music while working</title>

      <description>Finally found some appropriate background music for when I&amp;rsquo;m working.&#xA;My peers used to always ask me what I listen to while working on my computer, and they&amp;rsquo;re always shocked to find out that I work in silence. I used to unironically listen to lofi hip hop mix 📚 beats to relax/study to but I get too sleepy. When I listen to music I actually like listening to, I get too distracted.</description>

      <description>Slept pretty much until the afternoon and then worked on CitySync stuff.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s already Sunday so I basically skipped 2 days of journalling. I definitely need to streamline this process. I could try using Obsidian for easier journalling and then automate the publishing process.</description>

      <description>Hung out with the Gen Z gang today (actually millennials).&#xA;Walked around downtown at -20°C which was fun.&#xA;Went hotpot and Hanjan which basically broke resolutions 1 &amp;amp; 3 but it&amp;rsquo;s all good.</description>

      <description>I got my passport today so I am now legally allowed to leave the country 😌&#xA;I think I should start scheduling my off-work hours because I&amp;rsquo;m bad at time management and get distracted easily. It&amp;rsquo;s already past midnight that I&amp;rsquo;m writing on the journal.&#xA;EDIT:&#xA;I forgot to add why I wanted to do this in the first place. I found an old notebook of mine from 5+ years ago that had this entry:</description>

      <description>Fall 2023 was my first semester coming back after being out of school for 16 months (I tried taking CHINA 101 in Fall 2022 but dropped it after a week).&#xA;Because of that, I have forgotten how to study. Both midterms and finals went pretty horribly. It&amp;rsquo;s not even that I don&amp;rsquo;t care about grades anymore, and I definitely could have done better if I just did the practice exams thoughtfully.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago, I help a friend set up a website for a business. Today, I had another talk with a friend about building a portfolio website and he asked me for a few resources. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a comprehensive one that outlines all the required steps so I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best.&#xA;What is a static website? From ChatGPT:&#xA;Basically:&#xA;Static - no server-side logic, cheaper Dynamic - with server-side logic, more expensive What makes a (static) website Setting up a static website is basically free these days, maybe a few dollars a year if you want a custom domain.</description>

      <description>I deleted all 4 of my NPM packages today. It has been over a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve last updated them, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to add any more clutter to the system.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that having published open source code meant something, but then I realized that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it&amp;rsquo;s not useful.&#xA;Learning how to package libraries and applications was a good experience, though, and I would probably publish stuff IF/WHEN I have actually solved a need.</description>

      <description>You might have to zoom in a little bit to see these bad boys. They sing a just-intonated major pentatonic scale from a low fifth to a high sixth. Just enough notes to play Auld Lang Syne. Click/tap on a Pou to play a note1.&#xA;Keyboard controls: z,x,a,s,d,q,w for the notes, space for confetti.&#xA;Pou won&#39;t show up without JavaScript :(&#xA;Toggle Confetti It&amp;rsquo;s not as responsive on mobile sadly :(&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</description>

      <description>A new co-op position meant new hardware1, and a new technology stack to learn. Unfortunately, that includes having to use Windows. Coming back to Windows after almost 2 full years on Linux, it felt like I forgot how to use a computer. All the keyboard shortcuts that my hands were used to would do funny things like lock my laptop. I just wanted my shell, my terminal, and my tiling window manager back.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I made a meme about Go being my new favourite language (replacing TypeScript) and I just want to share a satisfying moment I had recently.&#xA;The Task In the previous iteration of my website1, I have a few lines in my config that fetches information about my published NPM packages to be rendered on the Projects page. I wanted to do the same for my new website, outputted as a Markdown table, which can be easily imported into the page with readFile.</description>

      <description>I feel like the hardest part of writing this game would be the enemy logic. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m putting it off for as long as possible! Today I implemented map generation, randomly placing boxes sufficiently far enough from players.&#xA;I also added controls for other players, which reminded me of my local multiplayer experience with Boxhead. I miss having multiple people on play a single keyboard. These days it would be awkward to play that way.</description>

      <description>Feeling good today. I got to fix the collision bug that was happening yesterday. It actually had to do with the collision lifecycle, so to make the player detectable, I decoupled the check from the lifecycle of the bomb. Because of this, I could revert the player&amp;rsquo;s bomb timer to normal. Moving away from a project and letting your brain sit on a problem for a while really does wonders.</description>

      <description>MAJOR BUG ALERT!!&#xA;Apparently my collision logic for the bombs weren&amp;rsquo;t going to hold up. Every time a bomb explodes, there is a small time window where you can place a bomb and the bomb would not recognize the player, making it a &amp;ldquo;not new&amp;rdquo; bomb. Because of that, the player gets pushed off right away and could end up in the weirdest of places.&#xA;After hours of debugging I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really solve it because of how the collision library orders the entity updates.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been heavily configuring my text editor, Neovim, which means that I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of Lua. I do&#xA;find it enjoyable, even without having any tooling initially, so I wanted to give game development and&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://love2d.org&#34;&gt;Love2D&lt;/a&gt; a try. I just finished&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents&#34;&gt;Sheepolution&amp;rsquo;s How to LÖVE&lt;/a&gt; book on Love2D, and felt prepared to make&#xA;my first game from scratch. As per Jherzey&amp;rsquo;s request, I&amp;rsquo;m creating a Bomberman clone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I learned what my actual height was (at least at the time of writing). For a few years now I&amp;rsquo;ve always kind of&#xA;just stuck with 170 cm because that&amp;rsquo;s what was in my driver&amp;rsquo;s license when I got it 5 years ago (I really need to pass&#xA;the road test this year). I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if that was right at the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
